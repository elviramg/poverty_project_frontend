        Poverty poses a significant challenge in the Country, according to CONEVAL's latest data, almost 40% of the country populations lives in poverty.\n
        So, identifying areas at risk of increasing poverty can help policymakers target interventions effectively. \n
        This intervention could lead to a better allocation of human and economic resources.

    Our data comes from Coneval's Labor poverty Trend Index ('ITPL by its acronym in Spanish'). By sharing this information, our main goal it's to understand how labor poverty has evolved over time \n

    We seek to develop our skills in data analysis with a socially responsible approach towards our country.\n
    Hoping also that this can serve as an aid in the investigation of poverty and helping policymakers to combat it. \n
    To be transparent from the beginning, you can find the data for our project publicly available [here](https://www.coneval.org.mx/Medicion/Paginas/ITLP-IS_pobreza_laboral.aspx)
